# Minor-2 Project: Metasploitable 2 & Mutillidae II

## Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of an intentionally vulnerable lab environment using **Metasploitable 2** and **Mutillidae II**.  
The goal is to understand vulnerable systems, perform basic Linux administration, and troubleshoot common web application configuration errors.

## Objectives
- Set up Metasploitable 2 virtual machine
- Perform Linux user management
- Use VM snapshots for safe rollback
- Fix Mutillidae II database configuration issues
- Document the entire process professionally

## Tools & Technologies
- Metasploitable 2
- VMware / VirtualBox / UTM
- Linux (Ubuntu-based)
- Apache, MySQL, PHP
- Mutillidae II (OWASP Top 10)

## Key Tasks Performed
- Created a new Linux user using `adduser`
- Verified user entry via `/etc/passwd`
- Took VM snapshot for system safety
- Identified and fixed Mutillidae II database error
- Verified successful application execution

## Documentation
📄 The complete step-by-step report is available in the PDF file uploaded to this repository.
